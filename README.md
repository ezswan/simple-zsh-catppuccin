# Simple ZSH Catppuccin v1.0.0 (Adapted by ezswan)

A customized ZSH theme based on the Catppuccin Mocha color scheme, adapted from the Dracula theme foundation. This theme features a simple and functional prompt with support for git status, time display, context, and directory information, enhanced with hex color support discovered by ezswan.

## Overview

This theme is an adaptation of the original Dracula theme, tailored to the Catppuccin Mocha palette. Key features include:

- Dynamic arrow color changes based on command success (pink), failure (red), or vi mode (yellow).
- Support for hex colors, allowing for precise color customization.
- Asynchronous git status integration.
- Configurable options for time, context, new lines, and full directory paths.

## Color Scheme

This theme uses the Catppuccin Mocha palette with hex colors. The following colors are applied:

- Pink: #f5c2e7 (success indicator)
- Red: #f38ba8 (failure indicator)
- Yellow: #f9e2af (vi mode and custom variable)
- Teal: #94e2d5 (time segment)
- Mauve: #cba6f7 (context segment)
- Blue: #89b4fa (directory segment)
- Green: #a6e3a1 (clean git status)

## Usage

The arrow (âžœ) changes color based on the last command's exit status:

- Pink (#f5c2e7): Successful command.
- Red (#f38ba8): Failed command.
- Yellow (#f9e2af): Active vi command mode.

Git status is displayed asynchronously in pink (#f5c2e7) with green (#a6e3a1) for clean and yellow (#f9e2af) for dirty states.

Time, context, and directory segments are color-coded for readability.
